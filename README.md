## Description

This project aspires to design a command-line application, the Custom Logo SVG Generator, to enable users to craft simple, personalized SVG logos swiftly. Through a series of prompts, the application collects user preferences like a text of up to three characters, its desired color (either via a keyword or a hexadecimal value), a choice of shape (circle, triangle, or square), and the respective shape's color. Harnessing these inputs, the program then produces an SVG file named logo.svg. Upon successful generation, users receive a confirmation "Generated logo.svg" in the command line. When visualized in any browser, the logo manifests as a 300x200 pixel image that perfectly mirrors the specified attributes, serving as a quick and efficient tool for immediate logo design necessities.
